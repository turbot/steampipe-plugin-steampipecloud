# Steampipe Cloud + Steampipe

[Steampipe Cloud](https://cloud.steampipe.io/) is a fully managed SaaS platform for hosting Steampipe instances.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

For example:

```sql
select
  user_handle,
  email,
  status
from
  steampipecloud_org_member
where
  status = 'pending'
```

```
> select user_handle, email, status from steampipecloud_org_member
+-------------+------------------+----------+
| user_handle | email            | status   |
+-------------+------------------+----------+
| mario       | mario@turbot.com | pending  |
| yoshi       | yoshi@turbot.com | pending  |
+-------------+------------------+----------+
```

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Steampipe Cloud plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install steampipecloud
```

### Configuration

Installing the latest Steampipe Cloud plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/steampipecloud.spc`) with a single connection named `steampipecloud`:

```hcl
connection "steampipecloud" {
  plugin = "steampipecloud"

  # Token for your Steampipe Cloud user
  token = "YOUR_STEAMPIPECLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN"
}
```

- `token` (required) - [API tokens](https://steampipe.io/docs/cloud/profile#api-tokens) can be used to access the Steampipe Cloud API or to connect to Steampipe Cloud workspaces from the Steampipe CLI. May alternatively be set via the `STEAMPIPE_CLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable.
